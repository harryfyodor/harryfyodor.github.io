#### ADAPTIVE BOOSTED NON-UNIFORM MCE FOR KEYWORD SPOTTING ON SPONTANEOUS SPEECH
类型：AdaBoost, Spontaneous Speech, MCE, Discriminative training

#### AN ACOUSTIC SEGMENT MODELING APPROACH TO QUERY-BY-EXAMPLE SPOKEN TERM DETECTION
This framework employs a tokenizer to convert query examples and test utterances into frame-level posteriorgrams, and applies dynamic time warping to match the query posteriorgrams with test posteriorgrams to locate possible occurrences of the query term.

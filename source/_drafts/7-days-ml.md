* Exploratory Analysis
First, "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.
* Data Cleaning
Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms.
* Feature Engineering
Next, help your algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.
* Algorithm Selection
Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.
* Model Training
Finally, train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you've done the first 


* Project Scoping
Sometimes, you'll need to roadmap the project and anticipate data needs.
* Data Wrangling
You may also need to restructure your dataset into a format that algorithms can handle.
* Preprocessing
Often, transforming your features first can further improve performance.
* Ensembling
You can squeeze out even more performance by combining multiple models.
